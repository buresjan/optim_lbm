Creating the Python Interface to NOMAD (PyNomad) requires to build 
source codes. The build procedure relies on Python 3.6 and Cython 0.24 
or higher. A simple way to make it work is to first install the Anaconda 
package manager.

************
KNOWN ISSUES
************
If NOMAD has been compiled with gcc 9.1, running PyNomad may fail.

On OSX with ARM64 and X86 architectures.
There might be incompatibility between the Python API binaries and
the binaries obtained when building Nomad. When importing PyNomad in
a python shell, this can result in a message like :
ImportError: dlopen(xxxx/PyNomad.cpython-39-darwin.so, 0x0002) .... 
(mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture (have 'arm64', need 'x86_64'))
or
ImportError: dlopen(xxxx/PyNomad.cpython-39-darwin.so, 0x0002): symbol not found 
in flat namespace '__ZN9NOMAD_4_210Parameters17_typeOfAttributesE'

This issue can be resolved by forcing the architecture when configuring 
the build with a flag like -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64. The
build directory and the PyNomad.cpython-39-darwin.so in 
$NOMAD_HOME/interfaces/PyNomad MUST BE REMOVED BEFORE REBUILD.

************************
HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL
************************
The interface build is managed by CMake that can be run at NOMAD root. 

The configuration command:
   cmake -DBUILD_INTERFACE_PYTHON=ON -DTEST_OPENMP=OFF -S . -B build/release 
must be performed with Cython available (that can be done within a Conda 
environment: conda activate ... or activate ...). 
Please note that the Python interface do not support OpenMP.

For Windows, the default Anaconda is Win64. Visual Studio can support both 
Win32 and Win64 compilations. The configuration must be forced to use Win64:
   cmake -DBUILD_INTERFACE_PYTHON=ON -DTEST_OPENMP=OFF -S . -B build/release -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64". 

The Visual Studio version must be adapted.

The command 
   cmake --build build/release 
or cmake --build build/release --config Release (for Windows)
is used for building the selected configuration.

The command 
   cmake --install build/release
must be run before using the PyNomad module.

Also, for *Windows*, the path to $NOMAD_HOME/build/release/bin directory MUST 
be added to the %PATH% environment variable. This will allow PyNomad to find
the Nomad libraries.


**********
HOW TO USE
**********
Some tests are proposed in the directory to check that everything 
is up and running.

Import PyNomad as a module and run PyNomad.info() to obtain the interface 
usage. To obtain help on a Nomad parameter, run PyNomad.help("keyword").
To list all attributes and functions, execute dir(PyNomad).

NOMAD parameters are provided in a list of strings using the same syntax 
as used in the NOMAD parameter files. Several tests and examples are 
proposed in the PyNomad directory to check that everything is up and 
running:
        python runTest.py
        python runTest_BlockEval.py
        Python runTest_PbWithConst.py
